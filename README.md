# Optimising-Parralel-Matrix-Multiplication
This study explores how parallel computing with Python and MPI performs matrix multiplication on the Univaq Supercomputer, analyzing how varying the number of compute nodes (1–10) impacts execution time, speedup, efficiency, and overhead using a fixed 15×15 matrix.
